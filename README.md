## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Supabase account (for authentication)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see Environment Configuration below)
4. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`

### Environment Configuration

The following environment variables are required for deployment:

#### File Upload Configuration
- `UPLOAD_DIR`: Directory path for persistent file storage (e.g., `/data/uploads` for Railway volumes)
  - **Default**: `uploads/` (local directory)
  - **Production**: Should point to persistent volume mount path
  - **Description**: All uploaded files (enterprise agreements, documents, etc.) will be stored in this directory

#### Database Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)

#### Railway Deployment

For Railway deployment, ensure:
1. Set `UPLOAD_DIR` environment variable to your persistent volume mount path (e.g., `/data/uploads`)
2. Use the correct start command: `pnpm start`
3. Mount a persistent volume to the path specified in `UPLOAD_DIR`

**Note**: Without proper `UPLOAD_DIR` configuration, uploaded files will be lost on container restart/redeploy.
