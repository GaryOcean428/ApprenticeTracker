   - Enhance incident management workflow
   - Implement reporting with export functionality
   - Connect WHS data to host employer records

2. **Begin Government Claims Management Module**
   - Design database schema for claims tracking
   - Implement eligibility tracking functionality
   - Create initial UI components for claims management

3. **Continue Host Employer Billing Development**
   - Complete Fair Work API integration
   - Implement configurable on-cost calculations
   - Create rate engine prototype with apprentice level adjustment

4. **Address Technical Debt**
   - Fix TypeScript typing issues across components
   - Implement consistent error handling
   - Improve form validation across all modules

## Conclusion

The ApprenticeTracker project has made significant progress, particularly in establishing the technical foundation and implementing the WHS module. The documentation is thorough and up-to-date, providing clear direction for future development. 

The focus on Phase 1 (Foundational Compliance and Core Financial Operations) is appropriate given the critical nature of these features for GTO operations. The upcoming work on Government Claims Management and continued progress on Host Employer Billing will address two major gaps identified in the analysis.

Overall implementation is proceeding according to the roadmap, with appropriate priority given to compliance-critical features as required by the National Standards for GTOs.
