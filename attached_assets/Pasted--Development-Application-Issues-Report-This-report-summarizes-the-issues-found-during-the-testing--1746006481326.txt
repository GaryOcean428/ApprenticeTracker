# Development Application Issues Report

This report summarizes the issues found during the testing of the development application at `https://684545d6-91c4-483a-baa2-4db3423cb37a-00-3c31str3a5ge7.picard.replit.dev/`.

## Summary of Findings

Multiple pages exhibit errors, including data loading failures, "Not Found" errors (both for specific data like apprentices and general 404s), and pages marked as "under development".

## Detailed Issues

### Issues Reported by User (Confirmed)

*   **`/apprentices/completion`**: Shows **"Apprentice Not Found"** error. This page likely requires an apprentice context which is missing or invalid.
*   **`/hosts/agreements`**: Shows **"This page is currently under development."**
*   **`/apprentices/progress`**: Shows **"Error loading progress data"**. The main content area fails to load data.
*   **`/apprentices/records`**: Shows **"This page is currently under development."** This confirms the user's report of missing sections (Identify docs, Qualifications, Compliance).
*   **`/apprentices`**: Shows **"Failed to load apprentices"**. The main list of apprentices does not load.
*   **`/hosts`**: Shows **"Failed to load host employers"**. The main list of host employers does not load.

### Additional Issues Found During Exploration

*   **`/settings/integrations`**: Shows **"404 Page Not Found"** error. (Initial URL provided by user)
*   **`/reports/compliance`**: Shows **"This page is currently under development."**
*   **`/apprentices/training-plans`**: Shows **"Apprentice Not Found"** error. This page likely requires an apprentice context which is missing or invalid.
*   **`/apprentices/rotations`**: Shows **"Apprentice Not Found"** error. This page likely requires an apprentice context which is missing or invalid.
*   **`/hosts/monitoring`**: Shows **"This page is currently under development."**
*   **`/hosts/vacancies`**: Shows **"This page is currently under development."**
*   **`/hosts/reports`**: Shows **"This page is currently under development."**
*   **`/training/modules`**: Shows **"404 Page Not Found"** error. The page route seems missing.

*(Note: Exploration involved checking pages accessible via the main navigation structure. Some pages might require specific user roles, permissions, or data context (like a selected apprentice/host) to function correctly, which could explain some "Not Found" errors. Pages marked "under development" or showing 404 errors indicate incomplete or broken functionality.)*
