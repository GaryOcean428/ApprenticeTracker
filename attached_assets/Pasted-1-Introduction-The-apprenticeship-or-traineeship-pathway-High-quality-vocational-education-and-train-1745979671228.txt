1 Introduction
The apprenticeship or traineeship pathway
High-quality vocational education and training (VET) is vital to Australia’s economic prosperity. It provides Australians with
the skills and knowledge they need to make a productive contribution to the national workforce. Industry expectations of the
skills and knowledge of VET graduates are expressed in training packages and VET accredited courses, with delivery being
the responsibility of Registered Training Organisations (RTOs).
One pathway for achieving a VET qualification is through an apprenticeship or traineeship, involving a mix of structured
on-the-job and off-the-job training. The theory and practice nature of this mode of training differs from the achievement of a
qualification in a fully institutional setting.
The apprenticeship model combines a contract of employment and a contract of training. It involves two legislative/regulatory
systems—the vocational education and training system and the industrial relations system.
The function of the legislative framework is to specify the circumstances in which an apprenticeship or traineeship can be
created. This is provided for in State and Territory VET legislation. The creation of an apprenticeship or traineeship under
this legislation means that the employer can access the award provisions pertaining to training wages, as provided for in
the Australian Government’s Fair Work legislation, and also access the various forms of support (often financial) provided
by governments. The training arrangements are set out in an Apprenticeship/Traineeship Training Contract and signed by
both the employer and the apprentice/trainee, as the employee. The two parties are also responsible for selecting the RTO
responsible for the delivery of training.
The achievement of a qualification through this mode provides the public with an assurance that the person not only
possesses a theoretical understanding but has also demonstrated competency on the job. In some instances, it also
provides for those qualifying as a skilled tradesperson to become licensed to undertake specific tasks within an occupation.
Group Training Organisations
In Australia, the employment of apprentices/trainees is undertaken either directly by an employer or via group training
arrangements. Group Training Organisations (GTOs) have as their core purpose to employ apprentices and trainees under
a Training Contract and place them with host employers. They undertake the employer responsibilities for the quality and
continuity of the apprentices’ and trainees’ employment and training. They also manage the additional care and support
necessary to facilitate the successful completion of the Training Contract.
GTOs take a multitude of forms; they are diverse in size, structure, governance and the scope and volume of services
provided. Most GTOs are not-for-profit organisations but some are for-profit. Some GTOs are stand-alone organisations
whilst others are structured as one element within a larger organisation that offers a range of services, such as training.
Some GTOs operate nationally across a number of states and territories whilst others operate within one state or territory
or operate as a community-based provider. Some focus their activity across a wide range of industry areas whilst others
have a single industry focus. Within these organisations responsibility for compliance will also vary, with staff in many small
organisations often being responsible for a range of activities, including compliance, whilst larger national organisations often
employ compliance focused teams with specific compliance expertise and training.
Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations
1The purpose of the draft revised National Standards for GTOs
The purpose of the National Standards for Group Training Organisations (2017) (the Standards) is to ensure nationally
consistent, high-quality services are provided by GTOs in carrying out their core role and in doing so, operate ethically, with
due consideration of apprentice, trainee and host employer needs, and enhance the reputation of group training as a model
of employment and training within the apprenticeship and traineeship system.
The Standards have been structured to reflect the key outcome for a GTO to develop an apprentice/trainee to become a
skilled worker who has completed a recognised qualification. To achieve this quality outcome a GTO needs to focus on three
key elements:
•recruitment, employment and induction;
•monitoring and supporting apprentices and trainees to completion;
•maintaining a sustainable business that is well governed and administered.
GTOs must comply with the Standards in order to be registered. State and territory training authorities are responsible for
registering GTOs in their jurisdictions and monitoring their compliance with the Standards. Registered GTOs are published
on the Group Training National Register website (www.australianapprenticeships.gov.au/group-training) and are entitled
to use the Group Training logo. Once registered, GTOs are eligible to apply for funding available for GTOs from Australian
Government or State or Territory Government programs.
The national quality framework for group training was established in 2003 with the implementation of the first National
Standards for GTOs, approved by all State and Territory Governments and the Australian Government. The Standards
were accompanied by a Resource Guide to support and assist GTOs and auditors in assessing their compliance with the
Standards and for internal review activities. These Standards were slightly revised in 2006. The National Standards for Group
Training Organisations 2017 and this Evidence Guide are the next step in this evolutionary chain.
National support for the Standards
The revised Standards and newly developed Evidence Guide were developed in consultation with states and territories and
endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments’ (COAG) Industry and Skills Council (CISC). This COAG Council consists
of the Australian, State and Territory ministers with responsibility for skills within their jurisdiction.
Whilst the apprenticeship and traineeship system in Australia is subject to Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation and
regulation the Standards reflect a national policy agreement. They provide a contemporary approach to assuring quality in
managing the delivery of apprenticeships and traineeships by group training organisations.
The revised Standards were adopted by all jurisdictions from 1 January 2017. State Training Authorities (STAs) will determine
the transition arrangements in their jurisdictions, including finalising any audits under the previous Standards, the process to
move existing GTOs to the revised Standards, the requirements for organisations seeking GTO registration for the first time
and any future auditing arrangements under the revised Standards.

Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations2 About this Evidence Guide
The development process
This Evidence Guide has been developed to strengthen the information and guidance provided to GTOs to help them
comply with the National Standards for Group Training Organisations (2017). The Guide provides practical examples of
evidence which GTOs might use to show compliance with the new Standards. Many examples have been drawn from
the support documents underpinning existing related quality and audit frameworks—including the Resource Handbook
which accompanies the existing National Standards for GTOs and the Users’ Guide associated with the Standards for
RTOs (2015).
Advice on examples has also been provided through consultations with STAs, National Apprentice Employment Network
(NAEN), state/territory Group Training Associations and their members, as well as from non-GTA members and other
relevant stakeholders.
The aim of this exercise has been to ensure consistency/complementarity, where appropriate, with other quality and audit
frameworks in the VET sector, while minimising the regulatory burden and maximising transparency for employers and
potential apprentices/trainees.
Providing evidence of compliance with the Standards
Essentially, the Standards describe the outcomes GTOs must achieve to become registered and to maintain their registration
status, but do not prescribe the methods to achieve these outcomes. The new approach to demonstrating compliance
against outcomes rather than outputs recognises the diversity of the sector, that each GTO is different and that GTOs are
best placed to decide the most appropriate way to structure and manage their organisations to suit their operations, those of
their host employers and of their apprentices/trainees.
This allows GTOs to be flexible and innovative in managing the delivery of the apprenticeship/traineeship and assuring the
quality and continuity of employment and training for the apprentice or trainee. As long as a GTO can present evidence to
demonstrate compliance with the Standards there is no ‘one right way’. Accordingly, the Evidence Guide does not prescribe
how evidence must be retained to demonstrate compliance.
In assisting GTOs to understand how they might provide evidence of compliance with these Standards, the examples in
this Evidence Guide (the Guide) are focused on GTO practice and behaviour, with an emphasis on GTOs being able to
demonstrate increased use of feedback and review and the action they have taken to accommodate the advice provided by
clients, where appropriate. This presumes the GTO has developed policies and procedures related to each of the Standards
as essential to guiding their operations. This differs from the arrangements in place for the previous National Standards for
GTOs (2003) where auditing processes against the Standards focused on satisfying evidentiary requirements through a set
of policies and procedures associated with each Standard.
GTOs adopting this new approach are more likely to have the necessary policies and processes in place which enable
them to operate effectively and efficiently, and less likely to operate as a higher risk organisation. Notwithstanding this, it
is recognised that a new GTO seeking initial registration would be expected to provide evidence that it has the necessary
policies and practices in place to begin operating as a quality organisation.
The examples in the Guide are designed to demonstrate how GTOs could show evidence to comply with the new
Standards, and in particular, how the GTO focuses on the quality of its service and the outcomes it achieves. The examples
suggest ways in which GTOs might provide evidence of their continuous improvement processes, including how they seek
feedback from stakeholders and clients and action taken as a result of their analysis of this input. The examples are not
intended as prescriptive criteria for compliance or a checklist, and do not reflect all the ways that GTOs can demonstrate
compliance against a Standard. There is no ideal number of examples of evidence which GTOs should provide. GTOs
can use one, some or all of the examples provided or develop examples of their own—as long as they can demonstrate
compliance with the Standard.
Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations
3GTO management and staff should use the Guide to obtain a clearer understanding of the Standards and the obligations of
a GTO and use that knowledge to structure the way they gather and retain evidence of compliance. In providing evidence of
compliance against the Standards GTOs should consider whether:
•the evidence is sufficient to show regular or consistent compliance as distinct from evidence of inconsistent
implementation;
•the evidence is authentic;
•the evidence clearly shows compliance with a particular Standard rather than inferred or general evidence.
The structure of the Guide
The Guide has been structured to focus on the three key elements identified in the Standards as critical to achieving the
key outcome for a GTO to develop an apprentice/trainee to become a skilled worker who has completed a recognised
qualification:
•the recruitment, employment and induction stage;
•monitoring and supporting apprentices and trainees to completion;
•a sustainable GTO which is well governed and administered.
Each element contains:
•The context—an overview reflecting the specific element of GTO business which covers the intent of a group of
Standards; and
•A guide to compliance—examples of the evidence which GTOs could use to demonstrate compliance with each of
the Standards.
Equipped with this information, each GTO can apply the Standards in the context of their own operational model.
Key users of the Guide
Key users of the Guide include:
•Organisations applying to become GTOs—to understand the obligations of a GTO, and develop systems and
processes in preparation for submitting an application for initial registration;
•Current GTOs—to understand their regulatory obligations, and to establish and maintain practices that comply with the
Standards and suit the GTO, its host employers and apprentices/trainees. In particular, the Guide is likely to be used by:
–– GTO staff creating and recording evidence of their compliance with the Standards as part of their day-to-day work;
–– GTO staff assessing evidence of compliance with the Standards as part of their internal review processes and to
guide continuous improvement initiatives; and
•
People outside the GTO—including auditors and STA officers, to help them make consistent judgements about the
intent of the Standards and how GTOs can implement the Standards in ways that suit them and their apprentices/
trainees and to help them evaluate the evidence for external review of a GTO’s compliance with the Standards.
To meet the needs of these users the Guide has been designed to:
4
•be practical, relevant and easy for users to understand and apply;
•help GTOs identify evidence to demonstrate compliance with each Standard, including identifying areas for improvement;
and
•enable a template for internal review and self-assessment to be developed, noting that self-assessment mechanisms
prove useful in the audit process.
Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training OrganisationsRelated issues
Legislation
GTOs, as employers of apprentices and trainees, are subject to specific apprenticeship/traineeship legislation and
regulations in each State and Territory. In addition, the RTOs they select to undertake the training element of an
apprenticeship/traineeship are subject to the VET Quality Framework, a system which ensures the integrity of nationally
recognised training in Australia.
Complaints about GTOs
Stakeholder complaints about GTOs are an important source of intelligence about the operation of the group training sector
of the apprenticeship/traineeship market. These are sometimes relayed to STAs or the Australian Government by apprentices
or trainees, host employers, RTOs and other members of the community. In some instances, these will relate to the
employment conditions associated with the apprenticeship/traineeship system and be subject to State/Territory legislation or
regulations. In other instances, they may relate to the operation of a GTO and the National Standards.
GTOs need to have in place policies and procedures for dealing with the potential for a range of complaints to arise.
These will often be resolved using the internal mechanisms in place; in some instances though, independent mediation may
be required.
STAs will also have in place processes and procedures for dealing with complaints and may use the information gathered
through complaints as part of its strategy for monitoring the compliance of GTOs and for gathering data on emerging risks.
Updated advice
The Guide may be updated from time to time through a national agreement involving STAs and the Australian Government.
Updated versions will be published on the Australian Apprenticeships website at www.australianapprenticeships.gov.au and
on STA websites. Any printed copies should be checked for currency against the most recent digital copy.
This is Version 1.1 of the Guide.
Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations
53 Providing evidence of compliance with the National
Standards for Group Training Organisations (2017)
1. Recruitment, Employment and Induction
The Context
As the employer of prospective and current apprentices and trainees, a Group Training Organisation needs to ensure
that an initial set of steps are in place for achieving the quality outcome desired i.e. where the employment and training
arrangements provide high quality on- and off-the-job training for an apprentice/trainee which results in their gradual
development as a skilled worker and their completion of a recognised qualification.
In the first instance, achieving a successful outcome requires GTOs to have in place:
•a recruitment process which results in the ‘right’ person being recruited for a job as an apprentice or trainee. The process
should ensure a match between the interests, aspirations and skills of a prospective apprentice/trainee and the
expectations of the GTO as the employer;
•strong processes for recruiting and assessing host employers who have the capacity to provide the facilities, range of
work and supervision in relation to the Training Plan required for the apprenticeship/traineeship i.e. hosts with the skills to
reinforce the off-the-job training provided by RTOs with on-the-job experience in their workplace and a willingness to
develop their skills in the management of apprentices/trainees and in mentoring etc.;
•the capacity to provide support to hosts to assist them in their role with an apprentice or trainee;
•transparent information relating to the employment and training arrangements, so that prospective and current
apprentices/trainees know and understand the nature of the industry area and the apprenticeship/traineeship they are
entering or have ‘signed up’ to;
•an induction program which ensures the apprentice/trainee knows and understands their obligations, those of the GTO
as their employer, as well as those of the host employer and the RTO selected. The induction program should also cover
the nature and operation of the workplace, the importance of workplace health and safety and the legal/regulatory issues
which need to be adhered to.
Standard 1.1
Before apprentices/trainees enter into an Employment Contract and a Training Contract, the GTO informs them about their
employment conditions, the host employer arrangement, the training, the support services to be provided and the rights and
obligations of the parties.
A guide to compliance
The GTO could demonstrate that in the recruitment phase it provides transparent, accurate and accessible information
about its services and performance as an organisation to prospective and current apprentices/trainees and has in place
mechanisms which aim to ensure the ‘right’ person is recruited for a job as an apprentice/trainee by:
•
demonstrating how recruitment practices include mechanisms for determining the suitability of an individual for a specific
apprenticeship or traineeship, including:
–– matching the interests, aspirations and skills of a prospective apprentice/trainee and the expectations of the GTO as
the employer;
–– how assessments are made of language, literacy and numeracy levels;
–– how the identification of special needs is initially assessed;
6
Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations•demonstrating that comprehensive information is provided to apprentices/trainees in a range of formats
e.g. paper-based, online and verbally, and that opportunities are provided to clarify information;
•demonstrating efforts which have been made to inform parents/guardians of apprentices/trainees who are under
18 years of age e.g. GTOs could ask apprentices/trainees and their parents/guardians to sign an acknowledgement that
they received information and maintain a register of those acknowledgements;
•retaining copies of the actual information and any advertising and marketing material used in the recruitment and
induction process. Retaining a copy and register of all approved material, while not mandatory, will make it easier for the
GTO to monitor its information services and marketing and allows this information to be presented as part of an audit or
in the investigation of a complaint;
•providing evidence of a system being in place (e.g. internal review, client feedback, complaints process), to monitor and
review recruitment processes and practices and the information, advertising and marketing material provided to ensure
effective ‘matching’ has taken place and information is accurate and not misleading.
Standard 1.2
The GTO inducts apprentices and trainees to the apprenticeship/traineeship system, including explaining:
•the apprentice/trainee’s responsibilities under the Training Contract, to the host employer, the GTO, the Registered
Training Organisation (RTO) and the school (if under School-based arrangements); as well as
•the processes involved in accessing support and dealing with employment or training issues that may arise.
A guide to compliance
GTOs could demonstrate compliance with this Standard by:
•
providing evidence of the conduct of an induction program for each apprentice/trainee, including:
–– the content of the program, how it builds on the information provided in the recruitment stage and how it focuses on
the apprentice/trainee’s responsibilities under the Training Contract, to the host employer, the GTO, the Registered
Training Organisation (RTO) and the school (if under School-based arrangements);
–– how the induction program is delivered;
•
indicating any specific efforts made during the induction process to focus on:
–– the nature and operation of the workplace;
–– industrial relations and workplace rights and responsibilities, with particular emphasis on cancellation processes and
procedures, including appeals, access to relevant bodies in case of disputes at a jurisdictional level or nationally
through the Fair Work framework;
–– workplace health and safety rights and responsibilities and various legal/regulatory requirements which need to be
adhered to;
–– ensuring that the parents of apprentices or trainees who are school students, or under the age of 18, are also
provided with the information associated with the induction process;
–– the support mechanisms available to assist the apprentice/trainee e.g. literacy and numeracy support, access to
GTO field staff, and for dealing with specific employment and training issues e.g. grievances/complaints;
•providing evidence that all newly employed apprentices/trainees have completed the induction process prior to
commencing work or training e.g. apprentice/trainee ‘sign off’ of induction checklist covering all elements of this
Standard;
•demonstrating how the GTO’s induction policy and/or the program conducted by the GTO is regularly reviewed and/or
has changed as the result of analysis of data or feedback from apprentices/trainees, host employers, the RTO or school
(in the case of school students).
Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations
7Standard 1.3
The GTO provides clear and accurate advice to host employers to:
•take reasonable steps to ensure they understand the apprenticeship/traineeship system; and
•obtain their agreement, by means of a Host Employer Agreement, to their role and responsibilities in training and
supporting the apprentice or trainee while in their workplace, in meeting their obligations to maintain a safe workplace
and in working cooperatively with the GTO and RTO.
A guide to compliance
GTOs could demonstrate compliance with this Standard by:
•
providing evidence of the processes a GTO has in place for recruiting and assessing host employers in terms of their
capacity to provide:
–– the appropriate facilities and comply with their legislative responsibilities as a proxy employer;
–– a safe workplace (e.g. evidence of a Work Health and Safety site audit);
–– the range of work and supervision required in relation to the Training Plan i.e. hosts with the skills to reinforce the
off-the-job training provided by RTOs with on-the-job experience in their workplace;
•indicating the mechanisms which the GTO has in place to support hosts to train and support an apprentice or trainee;
•providing an outline of the nature and content of the induction process and evidence of host employer participation via
signed acknowledgement;
•demonstrating the effectiveness of the GTO induction process, the GTO’s relationships with host employers and the
GTO’s support to host employers e.g. via analysis of feedback provided by host employers and an assessment of levels
of repeat business;
•indicating how the Host Employer agreement is regularly reviewed and what changes have been made as a result of
analysis of the GTO/industry environment and/or feedback from host employers and RTOs.
Standard 1.4
The GTO actively participates in the RTO’s development of the Training Plan, which is based on competency—based
progression and completion principles and relevant to the qualification, the occupation, the host employer’s workplace and
the needs of the apprentice/trainee, in conjunction with the apprentice/trainee.
A guide to compliance
Whilst recognising that it is the responsibility of the RTO to develop the Training Plan for each apprentice/trainee, GTOs could
demonstrate compliance with this Standard by:
8
•providing evidence that the GTO and the apprentice/trainee have actively participated in development of the Training Plan
and both parties have had an opportunity to ‘sign off’ on the Training Plan;
•providing evidence that each Training Plan is based on competency-based progression and completion principles and
relevant to the qualification, the occupation, the host employer’s workplace and the needs of the apprentice/trainee;
•documenting issues arising in the Training Plan development and implementation process impacting on the delivery of
the apprenticeship/traineeship by the GTO and/or host employer and referred to the RTO, and action taken to address
these issues;
•maintaining records of discussions between the RTO, host employer and the GTO regarding reviews of Training Plans
and negotiations and agreements about competency-based progression.
Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations2. Monitoring and Supporting Apprentices and Trainees
to Completion
The Context
The GTO needs to have a range of effective systems in place to monitor and support the apprentice/trainee to increase
their likelihood of completing their qualification and becoming a skilled worker and address issues which might lead to a
discontinued apprenticeship/traineeship. Achieving this outcome requires the organisation to be pro-active, have strong risk
management strategies in place and clear practices in customising its services to meet the needs of clients.
Demonstrating compliance with this group of Standards requires a strong relationship between:
•the GTO, as the legal employer of an apprentice/trainee;
•the host employer, as the purchaser of services from the GTO and the day to day supervisor in the workplace;
•the RTO selected, given their responsibility to engage with the employer when developing training and assessment
strategies for inclusion in the Training Plan; and
•the apprentice/trainee in undertaking their training and productive work.
The basis for this strong relationship is established through all parties understanding the roles and responsibilities of each in
the Host Employer Agreement, referred to in Standard 1.3 and the Training Plan, referred to in Standard 1.4.
Monitoring levels need to be sufficient to:
•maintain high level oversight of the progress of the apprentice/trainee against their Training Plan, including being able to
make a regular assessment of the quality and breadth of their work; and the adequacy of the supervision of on-the-job
training by the host employer and any consequent need to coordinate rotation arrangements;
•enable decisions about the nature and frequency of support and mentoring required in the workplace, in line with the
needs of hosts and apprentices/trainees;
•assess the workplace provided by the host and monitor workplace health and safety issues during visits.
While the third-party arrangement intrinsic to group training contains some risks, these can be significantly reduced by
focusing attention and resources on working with the host employer and the apprentice/trainee to monitor and assess
progress. Risks include putting the apprentice or trainee in danger from a workplace health and safety perspective, non-
completion of a qualification and loss of repeat business with the host employer.
Standard 2.1
The GTO provides services that meet the needs of apprentices and trainees to facilitate the continuity of the Training
Contract to completion and the quality and breadth of the training experience, including:
•support and mentoring throughout the Training Contract;
•providing resources or advice or procuring any special equipment for the workplace in order to meet access and equity
and Work Health and Safety requirements.
A guide to compliance
GTOs could demonstrate compliance with this Standard by:
•providing evidence of the support mechanisms advertised and available over the term of the apprenticeship/traineeship
and their usage by apprentices/trainees, including for specific population or age groups e.g. literacy and numeracy
support, mentoring;
•indicating the steps the GTO takes to assess the need for, and level of, support and mentoring for each apprentice/
trainee;
Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations
9•outlining examples of the analysis undertaken to assess the level of need for resources, advice or special equipment to
meet requirements for access and equity, workplace health and safety and the quality and breadth of the on-the-job
training experience;
•providing the results of analysis of the outcomes achieved by those receiving support and mentoring, resources, advice
or special equipment;
•providing results of assessment of the relative value of each support service and the mentoring arrangements provided
for individual apprentices and trainees to facilitate the completion of their Training Contract, based on feedback provided
by apprentices/trainees, host employers and RTOs;
•outlining examples of changes required in the provision of support and mentoring as a result of analysis and feedback,
and action taken to better target available resources to achieve improved outcomes.
Standard 2.2
The GTO monitors each apprentice or trainee’s progress against the Training Plan and:
•facilitates the integration of the training and employment experiences, including arranging for workplace rotations if
required;
•requests that the RTO review the Training Plan when changes occur with the apprentice/trainee employment
arrangements, including any workplace rotations, competency-based progressions or other changes.
A guide to compliance
GTOs could demonstrate compliance with this Standard by:
•maintaining records of discussions/file notes relating to progress against the Training Plan arising from GTO monitoring
visits to the apprentice/trainee workplace and documenting the identification of issues arising to be addressed by the
GTO, the RTO, the host employer or the apprentice/trainee;
•outlining the process used to assess the host employer’s capacity to provide the facilities, range of work and supervision
required for the Training Plan and actions taken to arrange workplace rotations, when required;
•indicating the number and nature of reviews of the Training Plan which the GTO has requested the RTO to undertake as
a result of changes to apprentice/trainee employment arrangements, including any workplace rotations, competency-
based progressions or other changes;
•recording the analysis of the integration of on- and off-the-job training and the changes being made to the Training Plan
via feedback from apprentices/trainees and from host employers.
Standard 2.3
The GTO has appropriate systems in place, based on the scale and scope of its operations, to manage and
support apprentices and trainees in times of economic downturn or ‘stand down’ to facilitate the retention of the
apprentice or trainee.
A guide to compliance
GTOs could demonstrate compliance with this Standard by:
•
providing an overview of the policies and procedures in place to address economic downturn, including:
–– what has been done to find a new placement for the apprentice/trainee prior to a potential suspension;
–– how the governing body of the GTO has considered the risk of this occurring and made allowance for financial
reserves to enable specific levels of support to be provided to apprentices/trainees;
•
10
providing an overview of the GTO’s action to address ‘stand down’ where it has been used over the past three years,
including an assessment of the reasons underlying changes in levels of activity and how the risk has been managed to
support apprentices/trainees and facilitate their retention until completion;
Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations•
analysing the records of discussions/interviews/negotiations regarding the suspension or stand down of an apprentice/
trainee or the cancellation of an apprenticeship/traineeship over the past three years and showing how this has been
used by the governing body to review and revise policies and procedures.
Standard 2.4
The GTO provides assistance, coordination and accurate advice to host employers for the duration of the Host Employer
Agreement, and works with the host employer to provide appropriate on-the-job training, supervision, support and mentoring
to the hosted apprentice/trainee.
A guide to compliance
GTOs could demonstrate evidence of compliance with this Standard by:
•
maintaining and analysing records, information or data that indicates the nature, scale and quality of each of the services
provided to host employers over a period of time, including:
–– how often, what sort, and what levels of contact field staff have with each apprentice/trainee and with host
employers, and the nature of the issues arising;
–– how often and in what ways have specific efforts been made to assist host employers to develop their skills in the
management of apprentices/trainees and in mentoring etc.;
–– how often placements by rotation (when possible and appropriate) are required to take place due to economic
reasons associated with the nature of the employment provided by host employers, or to fulfil skill requirements
i.e. where there is the need for an apprentice/trainee to undertake on-the-job training elsewhere to demonstrate
competency across the full range of skills required within a qualification;
–– levels of downtime and the reasons for these;
–– the number and percentage of apprentices and trainees ceasing their Training Contract and reasons for cancellation;
–– differences across apprentice/trainee cohorts and across industry areas;
•action taken to address issues arising from analysis of the records, information, data or incidental notes kept within the
organisation;
•outlining and assessing the involvement of the host employer in supervising the attainment of competencies and their role
in the endorsement of competency on-the-job;
•seeking formal feedback from host employers and apprentices/trainees on the implementation of this Standard
e.g. through the use of focus groups, satisfaction surveys or other mechanisms; providing evidence of analysis of the
data and feedback received (together with an analysis of the complaints register) and indicating action taken to
address this.
•providing evidence that the host employers’ capacity to provide the range of work, workplace facilities and equipment
and supervision (i.e. via a list of qualified trades persons, skills audit etc.) for the apprentice/trainees has been regularly
assessed and reviewed and their assessment remains up to date and accurate.

11Standard 2.5
Where there are any performance issues with an apprentice/trainee, the GTO manages these issues fairly1, and records the
outcome and the feedback provided to the apprentice or trainee.
A guide to compliance
GTOs could demonstrate compliance with this Standard by:
•
outlining the number and nature of issues which have required action under the performance management policies and
procedures in place for apprentices/trainees employed by the GTO;
–– showing that the issues have been analysed to indicate whether they have been generated by the GTO or the host
employer;
–– identifying whether the issues arising are systemic in nature and require some action by the GTO with all apprentices/
trainees;
•demonstrating that outcomes of performance management are dealt with in accordance with the GTO’s policy and
procedures, are recorded, and are acknowledged by the apprentice/trainee;
•reviewing performance management policies and procedures on a regular basis to assess their effectiveness, including
taking into account evidence arising from the complaints process and feedback from apprentices/trainees.
Standard 2.6
The GTO complies with Commonwealth, State and Territory requirements for competency-based progression and
completion and supports genuine efforts to achieve the qualification in an appropriate timeframe regardless of the nominal
duration of the Training Contract.  
A guide to compliance
GTOs could demonstrate compliance with this Standard by:
•indicating the nominal duration specified in the Training Contracts which a GTO, as the employer, has signed with
apprentices/trainees, and the policies and procedures that guide the GTO and staff in complying with the requirements;

Evidence Guide to support the National Standards for Group Training Organisations3. GTO Governance and Administration
Being able to demonstrate that an organisation is not only well governed and administered but also viable inspires client and
stakeholder confidence in the GTO brand.
For GTOs it is important to have in place the governance and administration arrangements which underpin a viable
organisation, appropriate to the scale of the GTO. These arrangements are critical to compliance with the Standards
associated with the recruitment, employment and induction of an apprentice or trainee and supporting them in their gradual
development to become a skilled worker with a recognised qualification. Complementing this, GTOs also need to have in
place arrangements to demonstrate they comply with relevant government statutory obligations.
Business viability is critical to the ongoing sustainability of a GTO and the investment it makes in its services. The Standards
and Evidence Guide recognise that the factors determining the viability of a GTO are dependent upon its business objectives
and operating characteristics. For example, the factors determining the business viability of an industry-based GTO
embedded within a major Australian industry organisation may be different to those affecting a GTO operating across a
range of occupational sectors or a community-based provider.
If the viability of a GTO is at risk this is most likely to negatively impact on the quality of its services and its capacity to focus
on providing high quality skilled workers. Operational and financial business standards therefore provide important protective
measures for the apprentice/trainee, the GTO and the host employer, as well as acting as a disincentive for under-prepared
organisations to enter the market.
When GTOs comply with the Standards:
•
apprentices, trainees and host employers know:
–– their GTO is stable and well-governed, and are confident it will continue to operate, be properly resourced to support
the development of a skilled worker, and be safe;
–– their GTO has arrangements in place to prevent or limit exposure to non-completion or financial loss in the case of
the GTO closing or not being able to provide the employment and training;
•industry sectors and employers of apprentices or trainees can be confident that the GTO can adequately employ and
resource their staff to undertake the duties required and that the GTO will continue to operate through the life of the
Apprenticeship/Traineeship Training Contracts in place;
•governments can be confident investing in the services provided by the GTO knowing they are stable, viable, well
governed and administered;
•a transparent complaints and appeals policy is in place which enables apprentices/trainees and host employers to be
informed of and understand their rights and the responsibilities of the GTO under the Standards.
Allowing apprentices/trainees and host employers to easily engage with staff about any concerns they have can stop minor
issues becoming larger. Surveys of apprentices/trainees and host employers will also indicate ways to improve practices
before they escalate into an official complaint.
Notwithstanding this, a GTO needs to have formal mechanisms, transparent to clients and stakeholders, where the issues
do not relate to the complaints mechanisms contained in other legislative or regulatory arrangements.
GTOs should take care to develop policies to distinguish between complaints relating to the operations of the GTO and/or
the host employer, and those relating to aspects of the apprenticeship/traineeship which are subject to other state/territory
and federal legislation and regulations e.g. learning and assessment, employment conditions, workplace health and safety,
privacy and child safety.
