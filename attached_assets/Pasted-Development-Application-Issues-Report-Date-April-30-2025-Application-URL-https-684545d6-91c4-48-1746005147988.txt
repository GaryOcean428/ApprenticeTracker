Development Application Issues Report
Date: April 30, 2025
Application URL: https://684545d6-91c4-483a-baa2-4db3423cb37a-00-3c31str3a5ge7.picard.replit.dev/
Summary
This report details the findings from checking the provided development application for errors and missing data. The check included verifying issues on pages specified by the user and attempting to explore the site navigation. All pages reported by the user were confirmed to have issues. During the site exploration phase, a significant and recurring application connectivity issue was encountered, preventing a complete review of all pages. However, a substantial portion of the site's navigation structure was documented before the application became unstable.
Verified Issues on User-Reported Pages
The following issues were confirmed on the pages initially reported:
/settings/integrations: Returns a 404 Page Not Found error. The page does not seem to exist or is not correctly routed.
/apprentices/completion: Displays an "Apprentice Not Found" error message. It suggests the page might be intended for specific apprentice records which are not being loaded or found.
/hosts/agreements: Shows a message stating "This page is currently under development." The functionality is not yet implemented.
/apprentices/progress: The page loads but displays an "Error loading progress data" notification. The main content area for apprentice progress remains empty.
/apprentices/records: The page loads and shows some static content and template placeholders, but indicates "More Features Coming Soon" and that the module is "under development". This aligns with the user's report of missing functionality for Identity Documents, Qualifications, and Compliance sections.
/apprentices: The page loads but displays a "Failed to load apprentices" error message. The list of apprentices is not populated.
/hosts: Similar to the apprentices page, this page loads but shows a "Failed to load host employers" error message. The list of host employers is not populated.

Issue: The browser displayed a "Hmm... We couldn't reach this app" error page on both occasions. This recurring problem indicates significant instability with the application deployment, hosting environment, or the application server itself.
Impact: This connectivity issue blocked further exploration of the site navigation and prevented checking the functionality of numerous pages.
Conclusion
The development application exhibits several confirmed issues on the pages reported by the user, including 404 errors, pages under development, data loading failures, and missing functionality. Furthermore, the application suffers from recurring connectivity issues, indicating significant instability that prevented a complete assessment. It is strongly recommended to investigate and resolve the root cause of the application instability as a priority, alongside addressing the confirmed page-specific errors.
