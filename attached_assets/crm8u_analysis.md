## Initial Observations

*   This project, CRM7R (crm8u), also aims to be a comprehensive GTO system, similar to ApprenticeTracker (CRM7) and crm13.
*   The README is well-structured, acting as an index to further detailed documentation within the `/docs` folder (assumption, based on typical structures and README links).
*   The technology stack (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase) is consistent with ApprenticeTracker.
*   The modular structure (admin-portal, client-portal, employee-portal, etc.) suggests a micro-frontend or well-defined service-oriented architecture.
*   The mention of "labour hire" in addition to GTO functionalities is a key differentiator to note.
*   The presence of `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and detailed documentation structure points to a mature project setup, even if the last commit was a few months ago.
*   The name CRM7R in the README for crm8u and CRM7 for ApprenticeTracker suggests these might be iterations or related versions of a similar system. This relationship will be important to clarify.
