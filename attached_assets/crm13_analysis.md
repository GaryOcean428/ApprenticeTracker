## Initial Observations

*   This project appears to be well-structured with detailed requirements documentation, which will be highly valuable for understanding GTO needs.
*   The presence of extensive configuration files, testing scripts, and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` suggests a mature development process.
*   The technology stack (React, Supabase, TypeScript) is modern.
*   The detailed requirements documents under `/docs/requirements/` are a key asset for this analysis and should be reviewed if possible (though direct file access within the repo might be limited to browsing specific files if they are very large or numerous).
*   The project seems to have a strong focus on testing and development best practices.
