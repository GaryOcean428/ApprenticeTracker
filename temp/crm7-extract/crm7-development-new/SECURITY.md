# Security Policy

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management
- Multi-factor authentication (planned)
- Password policies enforcement
- Automatic session timeout

### Data Protection

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Data encryption at rest
- Secure file storage
- Regular data backups
- Data retention policies
- GDPR compliance

### API Security

- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- CORS policies
- API key management
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding

## Security Guidelines

### 1. Data Handling

- Always encrypt sensitive data
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper data validation
- Follow least privilege principle
- Regular security audits
- Data anonymization in non-production environments

### 2. Authentication

```typescript
// Example of secure authentication implementation
interface AuthConfig {
  passwordMinLength: number;
  requireSpecialChars: boolean;
  requireNumbers: boolean;
  mfaEnabled: boolean;
  sessionTimeout: number;
}

const authConfig: AuthConfig = {
  passwordMinLength: 12,
  requireSpecialChars: true,
  requireNumbers: true,
  mfaEnabled: true,
  sessionTimeout: 3600, // 1 hour
};
```

### 3. API Endpoints

- Use HTTPS only
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all inputs
- Proper error handling
- Security headers
- API versioning

### 4. File Uploads

- File type validation
- Size restrictions
- Virus scanning
- Secure storage
- Access control
- Metadata stripping

## Reporting Security Issues

### Responsible Disclosure

1. Email security@company.com
2. Include detailed description
3. Provide steps to reproduce
4. Wait for acknowledgment
5. Allow time for fixes
6. Public disclosure coordination
