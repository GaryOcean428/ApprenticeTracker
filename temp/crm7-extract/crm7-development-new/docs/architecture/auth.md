# Authentication Architecture

## Overview

The application uses a dual authentication system with Auth0 for API routes and Supabase for client-side authentication. All routes are protected by default except for explicitly defined public routes.

## Current Issues

1. Not all routes are protected by default
2. The CacheMetricsDashboard component needs to be converted to a client component
3. The middleware needs to be updated to enforce authentication first

## Required Changes

### 1. Middleware Updates

The middleware.ts file needs to be modified to:

- Make all routes protected by default
- Expand the public routes list to include all necessary authentication-related paths
- Ensure authentication check happens before any other middleware processing

```typescript
const PUBLIC_ROUTES = [
  '/login',
  '/signup',
  '/forgot-password',
  '/reset-password',
  '/api/auth/callback',
  '/api/auth/login',
  '/api/auth/logout',
  '/api/auth/refresh',
  '/_next',
  '/static',
  '/images',
  '/favicon.ico',
];

// All other routes require authentication
```

### 2. Component Updates

The CacheMetricsDashboard.tsx needs to be updated to:

```typescript
'use client';

// Rest of the component code...
```

### 3. Authentication Flow

1. User accesses any route
2. Middleware checks if route is public
   - If public, allow access
   - If not public, check authentication
3. If not authenticated, redirect to login
4. After login, redirect back to original route

### 4. Role-Based Access

Current role configuration:

```typescript
const PROTECTED_ROUTES = {
  '/admin': ['admin'],
  '/api/admin': ['admin'],
  '/dashboard': ['user', 'admin'],
  '/api/dashboard': ['user', 'admin'],
};
```

Consider expanding this to include all restricted routes with their required roles.

## Implementation Steps

1. Update middleware.ts to protect all routes by default
2. Convert client-side components to use 'use client' directive
3. Update Auth0 configuration to handle all API routes
4. Update Supabase configuration for client-side auth
5. Add proper error handling and logging
6. Update environment variables and deployment configuration

## Security Considerations

- Ensure secure session management
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Set secure cookie options
- Rate limit authentication attempts
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Testing

1. Test authentication flow
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Session management
   - Token refresh
2. Test protected routes
   - Verify redirect to login
   - Verify return to original route after login
3. Test role-based access
   - Verify proper role checks
   - Test unauthorized access attempts

## Monitoring

- Monitor authentication success/failure rates
- Track session duration and activity
- Monitor token refresh patterns
- Alert on suspicious activity
- Log authentication events for audit

## Next Steps

1. Implement the middleware changes
2. Update component client/server separation
3. Add comprehensive authentication testing
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Document security procedures
